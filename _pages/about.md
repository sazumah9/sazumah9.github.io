My name is Stephen Simon Azumah, and I am a junior majoring in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech with a current GPA of 3.3. I am originally from Stafford, Virginia, and I am passionate about building secure, efficient systems that connect hardware and software.

At Virginia Tech, I serve as a Student Leader for RSWBL, where I support first-year students through mentorship, programming, and academic engagement. In addition, I work at a Perspective Gallery, gaining experience in customer interaction, organization, and creative environments.

I am currently seeking internship, co-op, or full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills in engineering, cybersecurity, and embedded systems while continuing to grow as a professional.
